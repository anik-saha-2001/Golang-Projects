# Golang-Projects

This repository is a collection of projects and exercises as I learn Go (Golang) and build various applications. Each project explores different aspects of the language, from core syntax and data structures to advanced features like concurrency and web development. My goal is to deepen my understanding of Go through hands-on projects, with code examples, notes, and documentation for each step in the learning process.
